				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>This is a program where a worker at a pizza company may enter orders received over the phone
				into a computer system. This system will store a customer's name, address, and order information,
				and use this to calculate a price total and print a receipt.</p>
				<p>Below is the project backlog: </p>

				<h1>Sprint One</h1>

				<img src="assets/img/s1_plan.jpg" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s1_test.png" width="75%">
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>This version has a simple menu that I can work with during the early stages of this project, as
					well as the beginning to the main loop that will allow the program to run; these elements all work
				as expected, which can be seen by the screenshot of the outcomes in the testing. Next steps will be to
					allow the program operator to enter their choice of the pizza, which must be stored by the program.
				</p>

				<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
				<img src="assets/img/s2_board.png" width="75%">

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>The program now takes a user's order and stores it in the system, and is able to recall it later
					when asking for the user's confirmation. As I was writing the code in this sprint, it occurred to me
					that I hadn't actually planned to include an option where the operator could edit the order after
					initially entering it. This would mean the program is very inflexible and the operator would have to
					start again from scratch if he made a mistake. Therefore, I have updated the project backlog and
					plan to create another function that allows the user to edit the order. I probably won't implement
					this in the next sprint, but will instead wait until the receipt and delivery/pickup functions
					have been added - as it is more of an embellishment than an essential function of the program. <br>
					<br>
					In the next version, I want to add a function where where the operator asks whether the customer
					wants their food delivered to their home address or not, then asks for and processes the relevant
					personal information (e.g. name, address, phone number, delivery charge).<br><br>
					There are a few problems with this version - the formatting on the printed lists is not as clean
					as it could be, and of course it still can't cope with any kind of unexpected input. I plan to
					address all of these minor issues when I have finished writing the main code.
				</p>

				<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
				<img src="assets/img/s3_board.png" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s3_plan.jpg" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s3_test1.png" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s3_test2.png" width="75%">
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p> The program now allows the user to tell it whether they would like their order to be
					delivered, or if the customer will pick it up from the pizza store themselves. The program then
					takes the customer's personal information based on this, and adds a $3 delivery charge where
					appropriate.<br><br>
				In the next sprint I want to restructure the code - I would like the program to be based around a
				"menu" of options from which the user can decide what to do with their order. This will be done in the
					next sprint. I believe
				this will allow for greater flexibility within the program, so the user has more control. It will also
				make it easier to edit user orders, a functionality which will be implemented in my next sprint.
				</p>

				<h1>Sprint Four</h1>
				<img src="assets/img/s4_board.png" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s4_plan.jpg" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s4_test1.png" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s4_test2.png" width="75%">
				<img src="assets/img/s4_test3.png" width="75%">
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>In this sprint, I completely restructured my code so that it was centred around a central menu,
					from which the user can make requests. I also added in several new functions, including two
					functions for validating user input to prevent crashes, and greatly altered the function for
					getting the customer information, so that it detects when the user already has information stored
					and allows them to edit it more efficiently. I have split the get_customer_info function into
					four separate functions (get_delivery_info, get_pickup_info, and get_address) to make this part of
					the process as efficient as possible.<br><br>
					However, the original goal of this sprint has not been completed. I came across problems with the
					print_menu functionality early on, which was a major component of my plans for the edit_order
					function. I then realised that I was too ambitious with early planning for this sprint and decided
					to change my focus to troubleshooting, fixing bugs, implementing simple validation functions, and
					updating the edit_customer_info function so that it had a more flexible design, elements of which
					I plan to reuse in the edit_order function. <br><br>
					In this program the user is still unable to delete things from the order or view their receipt.
					The delay in implementing these functions is due to the problems with the print_menu functions,
					which are currently not working. In the next sprint, I will fix this, which should allow me to
					implement the previously-planned edit_order function I had intended to add in this sprint.
					Once sprint five has been completed, I will be able to start fixing any final bugs and getting the
					program ready for completion.

				<h1> Relevant Implications Summary</h1>
				<h2>
					Future proofing
				</h2>
				<p>
					"Future proofing" means that this program will continue to be flexible and easy to work with well
					into the future. It means the code is easy to update, and easy to understand for any new developer
					who may potentially come to work on it.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Functionality
				</h2>
				<p>
					"Functionality" means that the program functions as it should.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Usability
				</h2>
				<p>"Usability" means that a program is easy to use to somebody unfamiliar with its workings. That means
				it is easy to navigate, interact with, and understand. I believe my program complies with this
				heuristic due to the extensive validation as well as the way it is laid out. The program is predictable,
				running from a central menu that the user returns to after each completed task. The user is provided
				with clear instructions and every step. If they do something wrong, a feedback message is printed that
				clearly explains what they have done wrong and what they must do to fix it. They are also given a chance
				to fix their own mistakes, and are usually asked to "please try again" after they have entered something
				the system cannot process. The program also takes advantage of the Python functions .lower(), .upper(),
					and .title() to make sure the user doesn't have to worry about simple things like capitalising
				their input. </p>
